The code is split across several notebooks which clean, analyse and graph data from CRSP and Compustat. I'll be the first to admit that the code is very messy from writing my dissertation in a frenzy. There's also a lot of repeated code. However, the core functionality should still be there, and might be good inspiration to anyone looking to use Python + Pandas + Stata + Plotly.

The statistical analysis using the GSADF can be found in (6) Analysing Compustat Fundamentals.ipynb. The bubble criterion is then applied in (7) Further analysing Compustat fundamentals.ipynb.
